# Prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for Turbofan Engines
This project involves the development of a machine learning model for predicting the remaining useful life of turbofan engines. The model is trained on a dataset of turbofan engine performance data, and is able to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life of an engine based on its current operating conditions and other relevant factors.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

# Installing
1.  Clone the repository: git clone [GitHub]([https://github.com](https://github.com/safia-bashir/Prediction-of-Remaining-Useful-Life-RUL-of-turbofan-engine.git)) 
2.  Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
1. Download the dataset from this link and unzip it.
2. Place the dataset in the data directory.
3. Run the train.py script to train the model: python train.py
4. Run the predict.py script to make predictions using the trained model: python predict.py

# Known Issues
The model may not be accurate for engines with significantly different operating conditions than those in the training dataset.
The model is currently only able to make predictions for individual engines, and cannot make predictions for a fleet of engines.

# Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project was provided by NASA and can be found here.
