Well, while training this model for more epochs, we previously observed that it is possible to decrease the validation loss to a very small number. But in that case, our actual test loss is not that great. This is because our model is overfitting the validation dataset. So to get a good test performance, we should stop our training at an intermediate value of the validation loss. We chose 20 epochs as that gives a good enough test error."

    "It is very likely that readers may get sligtly different results while running this notebook on their system. This happens because of the nondeterministic nature of some deep learning operations and dependence of libraries like `Tensorflow` on computer architecture. Therefore, to make our results reproducible, we also share saved models of all our notebooks. All saved models can be found [here](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/rul_codes_open/tree/master/saved_models/cmapss). A notebook describing the procedure to use the saved models can be found [here](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/rul_codes_open/blob/master/notebooks/cmapss_notebooks/CMAPSS_using_saved_model_deep_learning.ipynb). As a final note remember that hyperparameter tuning is more of an art than science. It is possible to obtain better results than what has been obtained here by choosing better set of hyperparameters.\n",
